## Editorial Principles
Read more about our [editorial principles](https://jupyter.org/governance/charters/MediaStrategyCharter.html) in our charter.

## Content Guidelines
The Project Jupyter blog is designed for community members to share valuable and educational content about Jupyter. Blog posts can be about various topics, for example how you got started with Jupyter, the latest extension you built around Jupyter, a quick tutorial on how to use a specific feature, and more. This channel is powered by our community members so there are no particular requirements for how the blog post has to be written. 

Here is an example of a potential structure:

- Title
- Subtitle (max 140 characters) â€“ summary of what the blog post is about
- Provide one image that represents your project - it can also be a code snippet
- Introduce your topic
- Why is this topic important? What are the benefits for the Jupyter community?
- Do you have an interesting user story or usage example? Include this here.
- Pick a specific usage example and provide a step-by-step guide so the readers can follow along. Make sure to include visuals or
  code examples so readers can follow along easily.
- Thank/acknowledge the people who helped make the work described in the blog post possible. This includes anyone who helped you
  write the blog post itself.
- End the article with the forward-looking statement about your project or research

Blog Post Examples:
- Shorter post: [European Commission Funds Jupyter Bug Bounty Program](https://blog.jupyter.org/european-commission-funds-jupyter-bug-bounty-program-b7b96f9831e6)
- Longer post: [Generative AI in Jupyter](https://blog.jupyter.org/generative-ai-in-jupyter-3f7174824862)
- Post using the Jupyter Voice: [JupyterLab is Ready for Users](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)

## RESPONSE TIME: Volunteer working group
Please note that we will vet content against our current editorial review backlog, and follow up with you if there are any issues. Plan ahead. We are primarily a group of volunteers and we will review requests for publication on a weekly basis.

## BLOG: Submission process (blog.jupyter.org)
- *Create a Medium account*. If you are new to Medium, create an account by following these [instructions](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004915268-Sign-in-or-sign-up-to-Medium).
- *Request permissions*. Email the Jupyter Media Strategy working group (JMS)  at jupyter-media-strategy@googlegroups.com with your Medium handle to be added as a writer of the blog. Once you are added as the authorized writer, you should receive an email that allows you to upload your blog.
- *Submit your story*. For step by step instructions see the following Medium [article](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213904978-Add-a-draft-or-post-to-publication).
- *Request review*. Email the JMS at jupyter-media-strategy@googlegroups.com confirming you have submitted the story.  and provide suggested social media text and image.

## BLOG: Social media amplification
Project Jupyter has various [social media channels](/social), provide the following information when requesting review:
- Content (max 500 characters for Mastodon, 280 characters for Twitter/X)
- Image for the post if one is available
- Social handles to include (for @mentions)

## MASTODON: Amplification of a message on Mastodon
The Jupyter blog is the primary channel with which Jupyter communicates with the community. However, occasionally there are messages for which no blog post exists and the JMS will consider amplifying posts on Mastodon.  Mastodon is our preferred channel as it best reflects the values of Project Jupyter.
- Content - max 500 characters or a link to another Mastodon post
- Image for the post (if one is available)
- Link to your work, for example a Github link (this will auto-generate an image)
