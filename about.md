Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the [IPython Project](https://ipython.org) in 2014 as
it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. Jupyter will
always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the
[modified BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

Jupyter is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the Jupyter community. For more information on our
governance approach, please see our [Governance Document](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/governance.md).

All online and in-person interactions and communications directly related to the project are covered by the
[Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md).
This Code of Conduct sets expectations to enable a diverse community of
users and contributors to participate in the project with respect and safety.
