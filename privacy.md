# F.A.Q.

This page answers frequently asked questions about Jupyter and data privacy.

## Do Project Jupyter software programs collect information ? 

By design, most Project Jupyter software does not collect any information about its installation or usage. Telemetry is an opt-in feature available through libraries such as [Jupyter Telemetry](https://github.com/jupyter/telemetry).

All software developed by the Jupyter Project, other than purpose-built telemetry libraries,
is free of tracking
code. When you install and deploy Jupyter software and libraries on your own
computers and servers, no information is collected by or sent to
Project Jupyter's developers.

Jupyter's privacy policy does not apply to third-party vendors that host Jupyter
products for remote or cloud usage. If you have questions about hosted Jupyter
products, please consult your vendor's documentation and privacy policy.

Some projects have their own privacy policies.
The [JupyterLab privacy policy](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/privacy_policies.html)
is one example.

## Do Project Jupyter services collect information?

Project Jupyter runs a few free services related to Jupyter. These include, but are
not limited to, nbviewer, Binder, and JupyterLite. 

These services do not store any user data on Jupyter-owned
systems. Because these services are publicly accessible, we caution users not to use
those services to process sensitive information.

## Do Project Jupyter community services collect information?

Jupyter has a [community page](https://jupyter.org/community) that
recommends mailing lists, forums, chat rooms, and videoconference calls for
users to meet and discuss Jupyter software. Some of these communities are
managed by third-party companies not directly affiliated with Project Jupyter
or NumFOCUS.

You should not need to create an account on any on those platforms to _read_ any
public content. You do not need to create an account on any community
platform to _use_ Jupyter software.

Except where noted, Jupyter does not host its community platforms, and we
do not control the data collection of these community platforms. Users should
read the privacy policy of each community platforms before they decide to join,
and users should contact the platform's operator if they have any concerns
or questions about their data collection practices. 

## Who can fill out my organization's data privacy information form on behalf of Project Jupyter?

Your organization may require software vendors to disclose required information
about their software's data processing.

This often includes, but is not limited to:

 - What data is collected
 - How is billing information secured
 - Background check requirements for people having access to this information

**Project Jupyter is not a service provider, supplier, or vendor** and so
generally **cannot** fill out these forms, for **legal** and **technical** reasons.

We maintain open source tools that your institution or others may install and
operate. Entities who operate Jupyter services for your organization, and with
whom you have a contract, are responsible for the privacy of your data.

As we do not have a business relationship with you or your institution, we do not
have a customer database, we do not have billing information, and in general you
cannot sign a contract with us.

## Who is my Jupyter vendor?

There are two broad ways to deploy Jupyter software:

1. Hosted by a third-party computing service provider (in the cloud)
2. Installed on your own computers on premises that your organization controls (on-premise)

If you are using Jupyter in the cloud, then look at the URL you use to access
Jupyter. This will likely indicate who your vendor is. 

If you are using Jupyter on your own machine, the way you installed Jupyter will
tell you who your vendor is. If you installed open source packages from a
freely-available repository, you probably do not have a vendor. If you installed
open source packages from a commercial vendor that provides support, contact
that vendor for support.

## How do I ask questions about privacy not covered by this FAQ?

You can ask the [Jupyter Executive Council](https://executive-council-team-compass.readthedocs.io).
