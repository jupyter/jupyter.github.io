    **Kernels** are the engines responsible for code execution. Generally
    kernels are associated with one language, but a few kernels can manage
    multiple languages, often simultaneously.

    **Frontends** are user facing application, usually in which you edit code.
    Frontend can connect to a _kernel_ which provides code execution. A frontend
    can either be a standalone application, or an extension for an existing
    application or text editor
