## Content Guidelines
The Project Jupyter blog is designed for community members to share valuable and educational content about Jupyter. Blog posts can be about various topics, for example how you got started with Jupyter, the latest extension you built around Jupyter, a quick tutorial on how to use a specific feature, and more. This channel is powered by our community members so there are no particular requirements for how the blog post has to be written. 

Here is an example of a potential structure:

- Title
- Subtitle (max 140 characters) â€“ summary of what the blog post is about
- Provide one image that represents your project - it can also be a code snippet
- Introduce your topic
- Why is this topic important? What are the benefits for the Jupyter community?
- Do you have an interesting user story or usage example? Include this here.
- Pick a specific usage example and provide a step-by-step guide so the readers can follow along. Make sure to include visuals or
  code examples so readers can follow along easily.
- Thank/acknowledge the people who helped make the work described in the blog post possible. This includes anyone who helped you
  write the blog post itself.
- End the article with the forward-looking statement about your project or research
