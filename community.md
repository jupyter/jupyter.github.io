Jupyter is a community of data enthusiasts who believe in the power of open
tools and standards for education, research, and data analytics. We welcome
contributions and contributors of all kinds - whether they come as contributions
to code, participation in the community, opening issues and pointing out bugs,
or simply sharing your work with your colleagues and friends.

## Join the Jupyter community

If you're interested in joining the Jupyter community (yay!) we recommend
checking out the Jupyter [Contributing
guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/content-contributor.html).
This contains information about the different projects in the Jupyter ecosystem,
the tools and skills that are useful for each project, and other ways that you
can become a part of the Jupyter community.

## Explore our projects

Jupyter has seen wonderful growth over the past decade. As we have grown the
projects now span multiple GitHub organizations. Jupyter projects may be found
in these organizations:

- [jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter)
- [ipython](https://github.com/ipython)
- [jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub)
- [jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab)
- [jupyter-widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets)
- [jupyter-server](https://github.com/jupyter-server)
- [jupyter-xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus)
- [jupyter-lsp](https://github.com/jupyter-lsp)
- [voila-dashboards](https://github.com/voila-dashboards)
- [binder-examples](https://github.com/binder-examples)
- [jupyter-resources](https://github.com/jupyter-resources)

Many organizations have a **team-compass** repo to provide detailed information
about the sub-community, its meetings, and contribution tips. 

## Participate online

Jupyter also has a number of online communication channels to help keep in touch.

As you interact with others in the Jupyter ecosystem, remember that we have a strong
commitment to being an **open, inclusive, and positive community**. Please read the
[Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md) for guidance on how to interact with others in
a way that makes the community thrive.

Below is a short list of gitter channels, email listservs, and github repositories
where you can get involved. **We always welcome participation in the Jupyter community**.

## Live events

Project Jupyter events provide a forum for community members to come together in person or virtually to share and learn from each other.

This page is for in person, one-of-a-kind events, for community engagement, see the community page. 

### Calendar

This is a calendar of regular online events.  It might not be exhaustive.

### JupyterCon

Global JupyterCon conferences provide opportunities for the Jupyter community to come together to learn and share.

* [JupyterCon 2017](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny-2017.html) ([videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL055Epbe6d5aP6Ru42r7hk68GTSaclYgi))

### Jupyter Community Workshops

[Jupyter Community Workshops](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshops-cbd34ac82549) bring together small groups (approximately 12 to 24 people) of Jupyter community members and core contributors for high-impact strategic work and community engagement on focused topics.

Much of Jupyterâ€™s work is accomplished through remote, online collaboration; yet, over the years, we have found deep value in focused in-person work over a few days. These in-person events are particularly useful for tackling challenging development and design projects, growing the community of contributors, and strengthening collaborations.
