Jupyter is a community of data enthusiasts who believe in the power of open
tools and standards for education, research, and data analytics. We welcome
contributions and contributors of all kinds - whether they come as contributions
to code, participation in the community, opening issues and pointing out bugs,
or simply sharing your work with your colleagues and friends.

## Join the Jupyter community

If you're interested in joining the Jupyter community (yay!) we recommend
checking out the Jupyter [Contributing
guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/content-contributor.html).
This contains information about the different projects in the Jupyter ecosystem,
the tools and skills that are useful for each project, and other ways that you
can become a part of the Jupyter community.

### Events

Many members of the Jupyter community host and attend events to connect others that use
Jupyter and other tools in the open data analytics stack, such as JupyterCon, Jupyter Community Workshops, JupyterDays, and other events. See the [Project Jupyter Events](/events) for more details.

## Participate online

Jupyter also has a number of online communication channels to help keep in touch.

As you interact with others in the Jupyter ecosystem, remember that we have a strong
commitment to being an **open, inclusive, and positive community**. Please read the
[Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md) for guidance on how to interact with others in
a way that makes the community thrive.

Below is a short list of gitter channels, email listservs, and github repositories
where you can get involved. **We always welcome participation in the Jupyter community**.

## Report vulnerabilities

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in a Jupyter project,
please report it to [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org).
If you prefer to encrypt your security reports,
