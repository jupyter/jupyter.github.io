Jupyter is a community of data enthusiasts who believe in the power of open
tools and standards for education, research, and data analytics. We welcome
contributions and contributors of all kinds - whether they come as contributions
to code, participation in the community, opening issues and pointing out bugs,
or simply sharing your work with your colleagues and friends.

## Join the Jupyter community

If you're interested in joining the Jupyter community (yay!) we recommend
checking out the Jupyter [Contributing
guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor/content-contributor.html).
This contains information about the different projects in the Jupyter ecosystem,
the tools and skills that are useful for each project, and other ways that you
can become a part of the Jupyter community.

### JupyterDays, JupyterCon, and other events

Many members of the Jupyter community host events to connect others that use
Jupyter and other tools in the open data analytics stack. For example,
[JupyterCon](https://jupytercon.com/) is an annual conference that brings together many
different groups represented in the Jupyter Community. **Jupyter Days**
are smaller, locally-organized events for learning and connecting with one
another. For example, [here's a post announcing Jupyter Days in Atlanta](https://blog.jupyter.org/announcing-jupyter-day-atlanta-spring-2018-d68ebee2c6cb).
If you'd like to organize a Jupyter Days event in your community, please
reach out!

## Participate online

Jupyter also has a number of online communication channels to help keep in touch.

As you interact with others in the Jupyter ecosystem, remember that we have a strong
commitment to being an **open, inclusive, and positive community**. Please read the
[Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md) for guidance on how to interact with others in
a way that makes the community thrive.

Below is a short list of gitter channels, email listservs, and github repositories
where you can get involved. **We always welcome participation in the Jupyter community**.

## Report vulnerabilities

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in a Jupyter project,
please report it to [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org).
If you prefer to encrypt your security reports,
you can use [this PGP public key](assets/ipython_security.asc).
