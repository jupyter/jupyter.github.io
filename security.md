The Jupyter Security Subproject exists to provide help and advice to Jupyter
users, operators, and developers on security topics and to help coordinate handling
of security issues.

## How to report vulnerabilities

To report a security vulnerability in a [Jupyter Subproject](https://jupyter.org/governance/list_of_subprojects.html),
take one of these two actions:

 1. **Open a GitHub Security Advisory** (GHSA) in the relevant repository (preferred approach). See [the GitHub instructions for opening security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
 2. **Send an e-mail to [security@jupyter.org](mailto:security@jupyter.org)** reporting the vulnerability. Only do this if opening a GHSA is not possible, or you are unsure what to do.
   where it will belong.

**We do not currently run bug bounty programs, and do not currently reward
vulnerability discovery.**

If you prefer to encrypt your security reports, use [this PGP public key](assets/ipython_security.asc).

### Guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities

- If you are unsure, it is always best to contact us.
- Remember we are an open source project maintained by volunteers, we have limited resources to spare. Please be mindful of our time.
- **Avoid** sending basic reports that just use website scanning tools without context or understanding of the problem:
   - Example: we often receive minimalist reports of JavaScript vulnerability or incorrect CORS on
     _static_ websites (mostly on jupyter.org and documentation on `*.readthedocs.io`). Static website are not affected by these kinds of issues.
   - Examples of how to do this more effectively:
     - You ran a tool and think there is vulnerability because you are learning. In the body of your message, include your analysis and your uncertainty about the problem.
     - You are a security researcher: Verify the tool claim and try to develop
       a POC showing how the vulnerability could be exploited, and the fix that could resolve the problem.
- **Avoid** sending mass emails to `security@ipython.org` (especially when cc'ing dozens of other emails from bug bounty programs)
- **Avoid** asking if we run a bug bounty programs or reward discovery in a private channel, discuss it in the public forum.


## Vulnerability information

Known vulnerabilities are tracked using the [CVE vendor ID 15653 for Jupyter](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-15653/Jupyter.html).

[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) provides alerts about vulnerable dependencies.
If your supply chain includes Jupyter projects, these alerts can help you respond to vulnerabilities quickly and easily.

## Security documentation

Several Jupyter projects maintain security-related documentation regarding usage or deployment of
Jupyter software.

- [jupyter-server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/security.html)
- [jupyterhub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/websecurity.html)

## Community resources

We are working to identify and coordinate security efforts across the Jupyter community and within all the various subprojects.
The [Jupyter Security](https://github.com/jupyter/security) GitHub repo has information how to participate and contribute.
For discussion, please use the special Discourse [security topic](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/special-topics/security/48) on the Jupyter Discourse server.

## Vendor assessments

Jupyter cannot provide, or fill in "Plan-Risk Assessment", "Hecvat", "Vpat" and
similar vendor assessing questionnaire.

You likely have been redirected to this section after contacting the  Jupyter
security team to fill in a questionnaire about the security best practice of your
Jupyter "vendor", and to assess the Jupyter "product".

The Jupyter Team and Jupyter Security team are not vendors, and cannot act as
a vendor. To be a vendor Jupyter would need to have a contractual relationship
with you, which we do not have.

Your questionnaire also likely ask how your 'vendor' store your informations
(user information, billing information, contact...); who has access to it; and
how they are vetted... etc. The Jupyter team does not have any contact or
billing information; nor do we collect; store or have access to any of the
information about how your Jupyter user use Jupyter, or what they do in Jupyter;
the Jupyter Teamã€€is not aware either of who installs Jupyter.

 - If you use a service provider for Jupyter; they are your vendor, and can
   answer those questions.

 - If you self-host Jupyter, then it is likely to your IT team to fill in those
   assessment as all the data is controlled by your IT team.

 - If you still do need a vendor assessment we advise you to contact one of the
   many companies that provide Jupyter support; We cannot unfortunately give you
   names out of fairness.
