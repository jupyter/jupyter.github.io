The Jupyter Security Subproject exists to provide help and advice to Jupyter
users, operators, and developers on security topics and to help coordinate handling
of security issues.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in a [Jupyter Subproject](https://jupyter.org/governance/list_of_subprojects.html),
you can either:
 - Directly open a GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) in the relevant repository
 - report it to [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org) if opening a GHSA is not possible, or you are unsure
   where it will belong.

If you prefer to encrypt your security reports,
you can use [this PGP public key](assets/ipython_security.asc).

## Vulnerability information

Known vulnerabilities are tracked using the [CVE vendor ID 15653 for Jupyter](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-15653/Jupyter.html).

[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) provides alerts about vulnerable dependencies.
If your supply chain includes Jupyter projects, these alerts can help you respond to vulnerabilities quickly and easily.

## Security documentation

Several Jupyter projects maintain security-related documentation regarding usage or deployment of
Jupyter software.

- [jupyter-server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/security.html)
- [jupyterhub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/websecurity.html)

## Community resources

We are working to identify and coordinate security efforts across the Jupyter community and within all the various subprojects.
The [Jupyter Security](https://github.com/jupyter/security) GitHub repo has information how to participate and contribute.
For discussion, please use the special Discourse [security topic](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/special-topics/security/48) on the Jupyter Discourse server.
