# What is where. 

Most pages are located at the place where their URL is, nothing fancy.  Headers
and footer are in `_includes/head.html`, `_includes/header.html` ,
`_includes/footer.html`.

The **navbar** is in `_data/nav.yml` and look like that:

```
head:
    - Home
    - title: Install
      url: http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html
    - About
    - title: Documentation
      url: http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html
    - title: Blog
      url: https://blog.jupyter.org
    - Donate
```

which mean, insert in order the following links into the navbar:

    - Link to `Home` page, guess the url by yourself. 
    - link to `Install` page, the url is...
    - Link to `About`, guess the url by yourself, 
    -  ... etc.

The navbar will automatically target `_blank` pages where the url is explicit,
and mark the correct link as the "current" one.

# How do I create a new page ?

Create `my_page.html` (will have url `https://jupyter.org/my_page.html`)
or `my_page/index.html` (will have url `https://jupyter.org/my_page/`), start with the following :

```
---
layout: default
title: My Page
navbar_gray: true
---

write some html here (consider you are already inside `<body></body>`
```

You can not do it yet with .md file, but you will be able soon.

Add commit (and don't forget to add to `_data/nav.yml`

`navbar_gray: true` start the navbar with a grey background if you need it.
