## Jupyter Community Workshops

[Jupyter Community Workshops](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshops-cbd34ac82549) bring together small groups (approximately 12 to 24 people) of Jupyter community members and core contributors for high-impact strategic work and community engagement on focused topics.

Much of Jupyter’s work is accomplished through remote, online collaboration; yet, over the years, we have found deep value in focused in-person work over a few days. These in-person events are particularly useful for tackling challenging development and design projects, growing the community of contributors, and strengthening collaborations.
